From the class email list:

The pcap files are very old, and some programs have trouble reading
them.  They can up converted a modern pcap format with:

  tcpdump -r <old>.tcpdump -w <new>.tcpdump


The traces for the assignment:

A 10 minute (2.4M) trace with no port scans (APT thinks):

  wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs491/98-10minutes.tcpdump
  tcpdump -r 98-10minutes.tcpdump -w 98-10minutes.tcpdump.new
