Summary of Approach: 

Part 1: 

We generate the list of IP addresses and ports that act as servers by
looking for any address/port pair that sends a [SYN, ACK] packet as these
are sent in the initial handshake of establishing a connection.

Part 2: 

We count the total number of connections to each server by counting the
number of packets sent to the server with the SYN flag off but the ACK flag
set, as these correspond to a client finalizing the handshake with the server
to establish the connection.

The total number of bytes served is calculated by summing the payloads of all the packets sent by the server.

Part 3:

We take the fairly simple approach of counting the total number of ports
of the target address per client that have been sent an initial SYN packet.
We take a modest threshold of 100 for claiming there is a possible port scan.
