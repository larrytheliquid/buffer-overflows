From the class email list:

The pcap files are very old, and some programs have trouble reading
them.  They can up converted a modern pcap format with:

  tcpdump -r <old>.tcpdump -w <new>.tcpdump


The traces for the assignment:

A 10 minute (2.4M) trace with no port scans (APT thinks):

  wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs491/98-10minutes.tcpdump
  tcpdump -r 98-10minutes.tcpdump -w 98-10minutes.tcpdump.new
  ln -s 98-10minutes.tcpdump.new no-scan-1.tcpdump

A 4 hour trace file with no port scans (APT thinks):

  wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs491/98-4hours.tcpdump.gz
  gunzip 98-4hours.tcpdump.gz
  tcpdump -r 98-4hours.tcpdump -w 98-4hours.tcpdump.new
  ln -s 98-4hours.tcpdump.new no-scan-2.tcpdump

A 35 minute trace with a quick sequential SYN scan:

  wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs491/98-week6-thursday-9amx.tcpdump.gz
  gunzip 98-week6-thursday-9amx.tcpdump.gz
  tcpdump -r 98-week6-thursday-9amx.tcpdump -w 98-week6-thursday-9amx.tcpdump.new
  ln -s 98-week6-thursday-9amx.tcpdump.new scan-1.tcpdump

A one hour trace with a slower random-order SYN port scan. 

  wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs491/98-week6-thursday-11am.tcpdump.gz
  gunzip 98-week6-thursday-11am.tcpdump.gz
  tcpdump -r 98-week6-thursday-11am.tcpdump -w 98-week6-thursday-11am.tcpdump.new
  ln -s 98-week6-thursday-11am.tcpdump.new scan-2.tcpdump
