# PacketFu Resources

I put the PacketFu docs in the ./docs directory. Open index.html.
The code will give you an array of PacketFu::Packet objects as the
superclass, and probably a subclass like PacketFu::TCPPacket.

# Running the code / getting a repl

## To install a modern Ruby (open a new shell after this):
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

## The first time, run this command in this directory:
$ bundle

## Now you can run this to get a REPL:
$ bundle exec ruby part1.rb PATH_TO_PCAP
