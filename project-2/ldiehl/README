# PacketFu Resources

I put the PacketFu docs in the ./docs directory. Open index.html.
The code will give you an array of PacketFu::Packet objects as the
superclass, and probably a subclass like PacketFu::TCPPacket.

# Running the code / getting a repl

## To install a modern Ruby (open a new shell after this):
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

## The first time, run this command in this directory:
$ bundle

## Now you can run this to get a REPL:
$ bundle exec irb ./part1.rb PATH_TO_PCAP

Packets is an array of parsed packets. So you can look at a particular
packet like Packets[42]. You may want to do something like look at a
source ip address:
Packets[42].ip_saddr
# => "128.12.173.14"
Or see what type of packet class this is:
Packets[42].class
# => => PacketFu::TCPPacket
