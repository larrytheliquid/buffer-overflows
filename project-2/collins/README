Build / Install
===============

Run:

  make

The libpcap headers must already be installed on your system.

Run Part 1 (list possible servers)
==================================

Run:

  python main.py 1 PCAP_FILE

The output format is:

  SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT

one per line.  Redirect the output if you want to save it.

Run Part 2 (list server stats)
==============================

Run:

  python main.py 2 PCAP_FILE

The output format is:

  SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT CONNECTION_COUNT TCP_PAYLOAD_BYTES_SERVED

one per line.

Run Part 3 (identify port scans)
================================

Run:

  python main.py 3 PCAP_FILE 100 VICTIM_IP

The "100" means define attackers as those sending SYNs to at least 100
distinct ports on VICTIM_IP.  You can of course supply other values;
this is just the value we chose.  You can also omit VICTIM_IP to get a
list off all attacks.

The output format is:

  ATTACKER_IP SERVER_IP NUMBER_OF_PORTS_SCANNED

one per line.
