If you want to run wireshark as non-root:

1. Enable privilege separation for packet capture:

     sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common

   and choose "yes" for setuid.

2. Add your user to the wireshark group:

     sudo adduser collins wireshark

3. Log out and back in for group changes to take effect.
