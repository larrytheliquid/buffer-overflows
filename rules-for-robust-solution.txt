  OK, for those of you trying to create a "robust" solution (a single fixed exploit
  input rather than just scheme for generating the exploit input in the target
  environment), I'll need to be a bit more precise.

  So suppose that you have access to (source code and ability to run)
  another dubious program, called "foo."  

  I will feed your input to 'badbuf' in an environment where the program
  "foo"  when compiled  with "gcc -o foo foo.c" prints "ea4c" .

  This information should be enough to get your target address in the right ballpark.

  Here is program "foo": 

  #include <stdio.h>
  void p(unsigned short i) {
    printf("%x\n",i);
  }
  main ()
  {
    int i;
    p((unsigned long) &i);
  }

That program is saved as foo.c here.
